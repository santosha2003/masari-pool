Great thanks to ArqTras :

    Open mysql (0.0.0.0, no more 127.0.0.1) . Firewall as protection so only leaf can access.
    host in mysql will point http://mainserverIP/leafApi
    Run pool module on leaf.
    Good luck wink

I got it to work I think :)


.. Setup mysql on the leaf pool or another DB onto main server (pool2)
 block manager will process leaf shares.
